# Adonis Based WebSocket Boilerplate

This is a bolierplate code for creating a websocket based backend. I'll keep modifying it and will add more capabilities to make it more usable for any usage.

This code already has the capability of broadcasting messages using edge engine. Some of the usages I'm targeting to add are:

* A ReactJS app using websocket.
* A mobile app using websocket.

## Setup

Clone the repo and then run `npm install`.


### Running

I highly recommend to use:
* [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) in development mode.
* [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) in production.
